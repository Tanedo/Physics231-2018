\noindent We will use the designated lecture \emph{and} discussion slots as meeting times. 


\subsection*{Unofficial Course Description}


This is a crash course in (a) mathematical methods for physics and (b) necessary science communication for your Ph.D. The topics are selected to be useful in your graduate coursework and research. This is not a mathematics course, it is \emph{boot camp} for physicists. 

\vspace{.5em}
\noindent\emph{Why communication?} Two common `failure modes' of early career scientists are the inability to \begin{itemize}
	\item \emph{write} clear papers, fellowship/grant proposals, (non-)academic job applications
	\item \emph{speak} their research to different audiences.
\end{itemize} 
These skills can make or break an academic career, even though they are never formally taught. 

\subsection*{Evaluation}

Five homework assignments (two parts each) will be assigned every other Monday.
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Short homework} [5 pts] due the following Wednesday.\\ 
		Quick reminders of key points in lecture, feedback on topics that may not be familiar.
	\item \textbf{Long homework} [20 pts+] due in 2 weeks.\\ 
		More detailed calculations, some short writing component. Optional `extra credit' problems.
\end{itemize}
\noindent
Each student will give \textbf{one five minute talk} [25 pts] during the course of the quarter. The focus of the talk changes depending on the week. Periodic in-class assessment in the form of \textbf{index cards} [1 point] will be used to help me tailor the course trajectory. No exams. I expect you to \emph{work together} and to abide by the \href{http://conduct.ucr.edu/policies/academicintegrity.html}{UCR academic integrity policies}.


\subsection*{Textbook}

The \emph{suggested} textbook is \emph{Mathematics for Physics \& Physicists} by Appel (\textsc{isbn}: 9780691131023). You are free to use whatever mathematical physics references you are most comfortable with. Some suggestions are on the course webpage.

\section*{Topics}

The main theme of the course will be understanding how to solve the partial differential equations that pop up in physics using Green's functions. 

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Dimensional analysis}. [1 week] How do you tell a physicist from a mathematician?
	\item \textbf{Differential equations}. [2 weeks] Are differential equations just linear algebra?
	\item \textbf{Complex Analysis}. [1 week] How do I integrate around poles?
	\item \textbf{Green's functions}. [4 weeks] How do I solve differential equations? %This is the core of a `standard' math methods core. 
	\item \textbf{Special Topics}. [3 weeks]  Special topics to be decided. Possibilities include: probability and statistics (how do you know when you've discovered something?), statistical learning (what is machine learning?), differential geometry (what is a magnetic monopole?).
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Learning Objectives}

By the end of this course, you are expected to attain the following learning outcomes:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Use dimensional analysis to determine scaling relations.
	\item Understand linear differential operators as infinite dimensional matrices
	\item Understand Green's functions as inverse operators
	\item Express Green's functions in terms of eigenfunctions of the differential operator
	\item Solve for Green's functions using integral transforms
	\item Be able to solve simple contour integrals
	\item Use contour integrals to solve for Green's functions of common operators
	\item Understand the physical consequences of analyticity (e.g. dispersion)
	\item Be able to apply Green's function methods to problems in electrodynamics
	\item Understand quantum mechanics as an infinite dimensional vector space
	\item Understand the basics of frequentist and Bayesian inference
	\item Be able to use likelihood to determine the significance of experimental results
	\item Understand the statistical foundations of statistical mechanics
	\item Understand how to solve differential equations numerically
\end{enumerate}
Additionally, following soft skills will be emphasized:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item How to write an academic research/personal statement.
	\item How to give a brief talk targeted to different types of audiences.
	\item How to ask questions in an academic setting.
	\item How to answer questions in an academic setting. 
\end{enumerate}

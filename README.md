## Course Description

This is a crash course in (a) mathematical methods for physics and (b) necessary science communication for your Ph.D. The topics are selected to be useful in your graduate coursework and research. This is not a mathematics course, it is **boot camp** for physicists. 

## Textbook

There is no required textbook, though I particularly like [*Mathematics for Physics & Physicists*](https://press.princeton.edu/titles/8452.html) by Appel (ISBN: 9780691131023). 

I strongly recommended that you have access to at least one general "math methods for physicists" reference. If you have a favorite one from undergrad, you may use that (e.g. Arfken & Weber or Boas). The book by Byron and Fuller is a solid choice and is inexpensive as a Dover edition. You can also find many free digital references through the UCR library.

* [*Mathematics of Classical and Quantum Physics*](http://store.doverpublications.com/048667164x.html),  Byron and Fuller

* [*Mathematical Methods in the Physical Sciences*](http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-EHEP000360.html),  Mary Boas 

* [*Mathematical Physics: a Modern Introduction to its Foundations*](http://scotty.ucr.edu/record=b4477256~S5), Sadri Hassani; digital version free from UCR Library.

* [*Statistics: A Guide to the Use of Statistical Methods in the Physical Sciences*](http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0471922951.html), Barlow; if we do statisticsl.

If you find references that you really like, please feel free to e-mail me to share them. (Bonus: make a GitHub pull request to add it to the list.)

## Evaluation

Five homework assignments (two parts each) will be assigned every *other* Monday. These will consist of a **short homework** (5 points, due the following Wednesday) and a **long homework** (20+ points, due in 2 weeks). 

In addition, each students will give one **five minute talk** (25 points) over the course of the quarter. Periodic in-class assessments in the form of **index cards** (1 point) will help me tailor the course trajectory as we go. There will be *no exams*. 

I *strongly* encourage you to work together. Please abide by the [UCR Academic Integrity Policies](http://conduct.ucr.edu/policies/academicintegrity.html).

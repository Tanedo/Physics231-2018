## Course Description

This is a crash course in (a) mathematical methods for physics and (b) necessary science communication for your Ph.D. The topics are selected to be useful in your graduate coursework and research. This is not a mathematics course, it is **boot camp** for physicists. 

## Textbook

### Textbooks

There is no required textbook, though I particularly l ike *Mathematics for Physics & Physicists* by Appel (ISBN: 9780691131023). 

I strongly recommended that you have access to at least one general "math methods for physicists" reference. If you have a favorite one from undergrad, you may use that (e.g. Arfken & Weber or Boas). The book by Byron and Fuller is a solid choice and is inexpensive as a Dover edition. You can also find many free digital references through the UCR library.

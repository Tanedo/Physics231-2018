## Course Description

This is a crash course in (a) mathematical methods for physics and (b) necessary science communication for your Ph.D. The topics are selected to be useful in your graduate coursework and research. This is not a mathematics course, it is **boot camp** for physicists. 

## Textbook

There is no required textbook, though I particularly like [*Mathematics for Physics & Physicists*](https://press.princeton.edu/titles/8452.html) by Appel (ISBN: 9780691131023). 

I strongly recommended that you have access to at least one general "math methods for physicists" reference. If you have a favorite one from undergrad, you may use that (e.g. Arfken & Weber or Boas). The book by Byron and Fuller is a solid choice and is inexpensive as a Dover edition. You can also find many free digital references through the UCR library.

* [*Mathematics of Classical and Quantum Physics*](http://store.doverpublications.com/048667164x.html),  Byron and Fuller

* [*Mathematical Methods in the Physical Sciences*](http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-EHEP000360.html),  Mary Boas 

* [*Mathematical Physics: a Modern Introduction to its Foundations*](http://scotty.ucr.edu/record=b4477256~S5), Sadri Hassani; digital version free from UCR Library.

* [*Mathematics of Classical and Quantum Physics*](http://store.doverpublications.com/048667164x.html),  Byron and Fuller

* [*Mathematical Methods of Physics*](https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/program/Mathews-Mathematical-Methods-of-Physics-2nd-Edition/PGM138979.html), Mathews and Walker

* [*Statistics: A Guide to the Use of Statistical Methods in the Physical Sciences*](http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0471922951.html), Barlow; if we do statistics.

If you find references that you really like, please feel free to e-mail me to share them. (Bonus: make a GitHub pull request to add it to the list.)

It may be useful to refer to [last year's course notes](https://github.com/Tanedo/P231-2017). The [2016 version if this course](https://github.com/Tanedo/P231-2016) was more [differential] geometric, though also more prone to have errors.

## Evaluation

Five homework assignments (two parts each) will be assigned every *other* Monday. These will consist of a **short homework** (5 points, due the following Wednesday) and a **long homework** (20+ points, due in 2 weeks). 

In addition, each students will give one **five minute talk** (25 points) over the course of the quarter. Periodic in-class assessments in the form of **index cards** (1 point) will help me tailor the course trajectory as we go. There will be *no exams*. 

I *strongly* encourage you to work together. Please abide by the [UCR Academic Integrity Policies](http://conduct.ucr.edu/policies/academicintegrity.html).

## "Lecture" Notes

These notes are provided *as is* and may have errors. They also do *not* include the questions and discussions from class. The most meaningful parts of this class (like grad school as a whole) will be unscripted.

* [Meeting 01](https://github.com/Tanedo/Physics231-2018/blob/master/lectures/Lec01.pdf): Welcome, dimensional Analysis. **Index Card**: (1) What should I know about you? (2) How do you learn?

* [Meeting 02-03](https://github.com/Tanedo/Physics231-2018/blob/master/lectures/Lec02-03.pdf): Scaling, error analysis with dimensional analysis. Discretized functions as vector spaces, derivatives as linear operators. **Suggested reading:** *[Linear Algebra Done Right](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-11080-6)*, Axler. First few chapters as needed. You can access the book through the library when you're on the UCR network. If you're off-campus, you can use the [UCR VPN](http://cnc.ucr.edu/vpn/).

* [Meeting 04](https://github.com/Tanedo/Physics231-2018/blob/master/lectures/Lec04.pdf): HW1b question and answer session. Discretized functions review. **Index Card**: How will you be evaluated after your PhD? **Suggested reading:** The books by Byron and Fuller, Mathews and Walker cover this type of materials. You will also find problems similar to our model of a molecule in Howard Georgi's [waves lecture notes](http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~hgeorgi/onenew.pdf). This line of thought led to ideas like [dimensional deconstruction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensional_deconstruction). 

* [Meeting 05](https://github.com/Tanedo/Physics231-2018/blob/master/lectures/Lec05.pdf): Row vectors as linear transformations on vectors. Bases. Bra-ket notation.

* [Meeting 07](https://github.com/Tanedo/Physics231-2018/blob/master/lectures/Lec07.pdf): Green's functions in linear algebra: a trivial example. Sample pop talk: focusing on your audience. Life pro tips for surviving graduate school. 

* [Meeting 08](https://github.com/Tanedo/Physics231-2018/blob/master/lectures/Lec08.pdf): Q & A and Pop Talks. **Index Card**: observations of good traits and pitfalls in today's pop talks. 

* [Meeting 09](https://github.com/Tanedo/Physics231-2018/blob/master/lectures/Lec09.pdf): Inner products on function space. Self-adjoitness, Hermiticity, all that.

* Meeting 12: Q & A and Pop Talks
